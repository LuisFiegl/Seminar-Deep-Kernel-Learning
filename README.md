This repository contains all the code used for the experiments (incl. supporting plots in gaussian_process_plots.ipynb) of my seminar thesis *Deep Kernel Learning* for the seminar *Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning* at LMU Munich (summer term 2024)

Each presented model has its own jupyter notebook, with which the experiments on the chosen datasets can be conducted.
